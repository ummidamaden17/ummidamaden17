👋 Hi, I’m @ummidamaden17, a third-year student at JIHC College studying mobile development. I'm passionate about bringing ideas to life through code and building mobile apps that make a difference.

👀 I’m interested in mobile app development, especially using Flutter, Android Studio, and Dart. I also enjoy reading books across different genres and staying active through sports like basketball and running.

🌱 I’m currently learning mobile development techniques, focusing on UI/UX design, app optimization, and implementing new features in Flutter.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mobile app projects that aim to solve problems, whether it's in health, sports, or education. I'm open to brainstorming and building creative solutions with other developers.

📫 How to reach me: [madenumida@gmail.com](mailto:madenumida@gmail.com) or [@ummi_mdn14](https://t.me/ummi_mdn14) — always happy to chat or collaborate!

😄 Pronouns: she/her.

⚡ Fun fact: I have a passion for sports and often find inspiration to study while playing or watching games!
